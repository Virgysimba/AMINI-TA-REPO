# Land Cover Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying land cover into three categories: Buildings, Cropland, and Woody Vegetation Cover (>60%) using geospatial data. The object is to develop a predictive model that outputs occurrence probabilities for each class.

## Project Structure

### Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.

### Model Training & Evaluation
Comparing machine learning models using log-loss and roc-auc.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimizing the best model for improved performance.

### Test Set Prediction 
Genrating predictions on the test set
